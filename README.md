Extracting images from illwinter's TRS gamefiles

its a piece of code used to extract images from a sprite collection of format .TRS
That kind of file is used by games from ill winter : Dominion & Conquest of elysium

there's a map for the monsters name that allow renaming of files to include their "subgroup" as they seem to be used by the executable (see marlin works on steam forums for those)
files are saved in ARGB png format.

massive credits nobless_oblige for its python script doing essentially the same. I just wanted to have my own version (couldn't run the python script)

the .jar should work as is

java -jar the_jar.jar

it should print the options
